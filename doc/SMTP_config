Configuring SMTP
=================

- Why do I need that?

So users can sign up and visitors can use the contact
form.

- Whatever! Make this quick...

Go to config/application.yml and you should see
something like this:

```
DOMAIN: "example.com"
SENDER_EMAIL: "user@example.com"
MAILER_DOMAIN: "example.com"
SMTP_SERVER: "smtp.example.com"
SMTP_PORT: "587"
SMTP_USER: "user"
SMTP_PWD: "pass"
```

For now, we'll be doing the testing using a singe gmail
account to handle everything. So the above variables
like the example below should work.

```
DOMAIN: "gmail.com"
SENDER_EMAIL: "hawksmarket@gmail.com"
MAILER_DOMAIN: "gmail.com"
SMTP_SERVER: "smtp.gmail.com"
SMTP_PORT: "587"
SMTP_USER: "hawksmarket"
SMTP_PWD: "blahblah"
```


Notes:
* Ask @sdimitro or any other collaborator for the test account credentials.
* If you want to use any other gmail account for testing you need to enable IMAP.
* The application.yml file is ignored by git so don't worry about uploading credentials by mistake.
