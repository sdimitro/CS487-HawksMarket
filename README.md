Welcome to Hawks Market <img align="right" src="hawk.jpg">
==================

This is the final project for CS487@IIT (2015).

###**Motivation:**
College life requires students to either buy or to get rid of many things. Imagine a freshman --
she has to buy textbooks and electronics for her class. She may need to find an apartment near
campus to live or register for dorming. On the other hand, you have students graduating that
could benefit a lot if they were able to sell a lot of their stuff, like furniture or books. The
problem is that the existing methods to buy and sell do not perfectly meet the studentsâ€™ needs.
They are either not reliable or too complicated due to their generality.

###**Project Description:**
This project aims to provide the means to make this procedure a lot easier and simpler for IIT
students. We will be building an web application that will streamline the procedure of buying
from and selling to other IIT students. Students will just post the items that they want to sell
with a full description, pictures and a price. Other students can look/search the list of posted
items and express their interest in buying them. After they do that, the seller of the item gets
notified of the interested buyer and their info. After this, they can arrange to meet up to
finalize the buying process themselves.

The benefits over the existing methods are the following:
- Buyers can ask seller to inspect item before purchase.
- Reliable - the service is exclusive to IIT students.
- No shipping time.
- Multiple Categories -Not limited to book purchase/selling or apartment finding.
- Room for negotiation.
- Well-defined target market.
- No communication overhead.
- A chance to meet more people from IIT.

###**Final Note:**
HawksMarket is only there to make a connection between a potential buyer and a seller.
No actual transaction can take place on the website. The two ends are supposed to meet
after the connection has been made. As a result, we are not responsible for anything
that happens during the actual transaction. Also, keep in mind that only public
information are shared through the website. Basically, no more than what is available
from the IIT Phonebook.
